Examples
========

There are tons of excellent examples in `PyVista's gallery <https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/index.html>`_,
but here are some additional examples more geared towards geoscientisits.

Many of these examples have made their way into the main PyVista docs, but I still host them here to have a complete list of geoscientific examples.
