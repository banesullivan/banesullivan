Numerical Integration
---------------------

Here is an introduction to Numerical Integration with Python!


.. code-block:: default

    import numpy as np

    import matplotlib as mpl








Let's look at a simple function:

.. math::

    g(x) = \sin(x)

which we know the analytical integral as:

.. math::

    G(x) = - \cos(x)

and let's integrate that from 0 to :math:`\frac{5\pi}{4}`. Analytically, this is:

.. math::

    \int_0^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} g(x) \, dx = - \cos(x) |_0^{\frac{5\pi}{4}} = - \cos(\frac{5\pi}{4}) + \cos(0) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 = 1.7071

We can visualize this as the area under the curve - which is all a numerical
integral is; an approximation of the area under the curve.
To do a numerical integration, we simply discretize our x space and then
evaluate our function. Once we have that, we can sum the evaluation and
multiply by the discretization factor to yield the effective area under the
curve.

So let's discretize :math:`g(x)` into several rectangles which we can use to
solve for the area under this curve.


.. code-block:: default



    g = lambda x: np.sin(x)
    a, b = 0, 5*np.pi/4

    y = np.linspace(a, b)

    dy = np.pi/16
    yy = np.arange(a, b, dy)

    def plot_rects(xx, f, delta):
        for v in xx:
            value = f(v)
            if value >= 0.0:
                loc = 0.0
                h = value
            else:
                loc = value
                h = 0 - value
            r = mpl.patches.Rectangle((v-delta/2., loc),
                                      width=delta, height=h,
                                      edgecolor="k", linewidth=1)
            plt.gca().add_patch(r)
        return

    def plot_g():
        plt.plot(y, g(y))
        plt.plot(yy, g(yy), "ro")

        plot_rects(yy, g, dy)

        plt.xlabel("$x$")
        plt.ylabel("$g(x)$")

    plot_g()
    plt.show()

      plt.show()




So now we can sum the areas of all of those rectangles to get an
approximation of the area under the curve (the integral)


.. code-block:: default

    np.sum(g(yy-(dy/2)) * dy)


    # That's not too bad considering our rectangles do not perfectly follow the
    # curve. Let's now try choosing a :math:`\Delta x` value that will increase the
    # sampling creating finer spaced rectangles to improve our approximation.

    dy = np.pi/32
    yy = np.arange(a, b, dy)

    plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
    plt.subplot(1,2,1)
    plot_g()
    plt.title("Area = {:.3f}".format(np.sum(g(yy) * dy)))

    plt.subplot(1,2,2)

    dy = np.pi/128
    yy = np.arange(a, b, dy)

    plot_g()
    plt.title("Area = {:.3f}".format(np.sum(g(yy) * dy)))

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

Now that's much better! as we decrease the :math:`\Delta x` value, we see the
apprximationm start to converge on the analtical answer for the integral.
The rectangles appear to be consistently overestimating the integral.

Integrating a Complex Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's apply that concept to numerically integrate a more complex function
such as:

.. math::

    f(x) = \sin(\frac{1}{x})

from 0 to :math:`2\pi`. This allows us to really showcase where numerical
integration benefits as I don't even know where to begin when it comes to
analytically integrating that.


.. code-block:: default


    f = lambda x: np.sin(1/x)








To do so, we'll need to define a range of x values on which to evaluate the
function. Let's try out a few different sets of x values to plot the values
of :math:`f(x)` to gain insight into how this function behaves.

First, let's see what happens when we plot this function at linear intervals
between 0 and :math:`2\pi` (note that we cannont have a division by zero, so our
lower boound must be some small value, not 0: we'll use :math:`10^{-9}`.


.. code-block:: default


    num = 100000
    zero = 1e-9

    # Create an array of x values to evaluate
    x = np.linspace(zero, 2*np.pi, num)

    # Evaluate and plot the values
    plt.plot(x, f(x))
    plt.xlabel("$x$")
    plt.ylabel("$f(x)$")
    plt.show()




.. image:: /python-blog/images/sphx_glr_numerical-integration_003.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

      plt.show()




Huh, that's weird. The function behaves quite different from a typical :math:`\sin`
function and we appear to see some sort of decay - let's look into that a bit
more. *At what x value are we seeing a change from oscillatory behavior to
a decay?*

From visual inspection, it looks like some value above :math:`\frac{1}{\pi}`
(0.318). Let's reevaluate the function from that x value onward.
Then find the maximum and see what interval of :math:`\pi` is causing the change
in behavior.


.. code-block:: default


    subset = np.linspace(0.3, 2*np.pi, num)
    subset[np.argmax(f(subset))] * np.pi





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    1.9999924576268395



Aha! It appears that the x value of :math:`\frac{2}{\pi}` marks the start of
decay. This makes sense because :math:`\sin(1/2/\pi) = \sin(\pi/2) = 1`


.. code-block:: default


    plt.plot(x, f(x), label="$f(x)$")
    plt.plot(2./np.pi, f(2./np.pi), 'ro', label=r"$x=\frac{2}{\pi}$")
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel("$x$")
    plt.ylabel("$f(x)$")
    plt.show()




.. image:: /python-blog/images/sphx_glr_numerical-integration_004.png

      plt.show()




So now we know that have a speration point in our function - this might come
in handy later. as we may have to treat those two regions of the function
separately when numerically integrating.

Now, let's explore the jumbled up portion of the plot for very low x values.
There appears to be some high frequency oscillation between -1 and 1, but we
can't really tell. To do this, let's create an exponentially varying x
space to evaluate our function which will bring out finer sampling for lower
values and see how the function behaves as x approaches zero.


.. code-block:: default


    x = np.geomspace(1e-2, 2*np.pi, num)

    plt.plot(x, f(x))
    plt.gca().set_xscale('log')
    plt.xlabel("$x$")
    plt.ylabel("$f(x)$")
    plt.show()




.. image:: /python-blog/images/sphx_glr_numerical-integration_005.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    /home/travis/build/banesullivan/mywebsite/python-blog/numerical-integration.py:197: UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.
      plt.show()




Now that's cool! :math:`f(x)` appears to have increasing frequency as x
approaches zero. This is quite different from a normal :math:`\sin` function where
we don't see any frequency change at all. This frequency variation will
definitely pose a challenge for our numerical integration as we will need to
make sure we properly sample this signal without aliasing.

Let's see if we can come up with an equation for capturing that frequency
variation as something we can use to build out our values that we will use
for the numerical integration.

First, let's evaluate our function between integer changes in :math:`\pi` to see
how :math:`f(x)` oscilates between -1 and 1. We know from above that the last
value of 1 occurred at :math:`\frac{2}{\pi}`, so let's use decreasing values from
there.


.. code-block:: default


    f(3./np.pi)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    0.8660254037844386




.. code-block:: default

    f(3./(2.*np.pi))






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    0.8660254037844387




.. code-block:: default

    f(2./(3*np.pi))






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    -1.0




.. code-block:: default

    f(2./(4*np.pi))






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    -2.4492935982947064e-16




.. code-block:: default

    f(2./(5*np.pi))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    1.0



So this is interesting. I'm seeing a weird pattern where :math:`\frac{2}{n \pi}`
appears to oscillate :math:`f(x)` between -1 and 1. Let's test this out.


.. code-block:: default


    xx = lambda n: 2/(n*np.pi)
    nn = 65
    n = np.arange(1, nn)
    xn = xx(n)

    plt.plot(xn, f(xn), "ro")
    plt.plot(x, f(x))
    plt.gca().set_xscale('log')
    plt.xlabel("$x$")
    plt.ylabel("$f(x)$")
    plt.show()





.. image:: /python-blog/images/sphx_glr_numerical-integration_006.png

    /home/travis/build/banesullivan/mywebsite/python-blog/numerical-integration.py:247: UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.
      plt.show()




It appears that the equation :math:`\frac{2}{n \pi}` captures the oscilatory
behavior of :math:`f(x)` quite well! We see that it marks the minimums, maximums,
and zero-cross points for every period of :math:`f(x)`. This is just what we need
to effectively integrate :math:`f(x)`.

To start integrating this function, we simply need to sample several times
between values of :math:`n`. Doing so is as simple as bumping up the number of
setting a step size in ``numpy``'s ``arange`` method. Let's use a step size of
0.25 as that will give us 4 values between each cross-over and the min/max
point. Let's see if that gives us a visually pleasing approximation of our
function.


.. code-block:: default


    def plot_f():
        plt.gca().set_xscale('log')
        plt.plot(x, f(x))
        plt.plot(xn, f(xn), "ro")

        for i, v in enumerate(xn):
            if i == len(xn)-1:
                continue
            value = f(v)
            if value >= 0.0:
                loc = 0.0
                h = value
            else:
                loc = value
                h = 0 - value
            delta = abs(xn[i] - xn[i+1])
            r = mpl.patches.Rectangle((v - delta/2, loc),
                                      width=delta, height=h,
                                      edgecolor="k", linewidth=1)
            plt.gca().add_patch(r)
        plt.xlabel("$x$")
        plt.ylabel("$f(x)$")
        return










.. code-block:: default


    dx = 0.25
    n = np.arange(1, nn, step=dx)
    xn = xx(n)

    plot_f()
    plt.show()

      plt.show()




That looks decent, but I think we can do better. Let's try 0.1 for 10 samples
between the cross overs and the min/max


.. code-block:: default


    dn = 0.1
    # 1/np.pi**2
    n = np.arange(1, nn, step=dn)
    xn = xx(n)

    plot_f()
    plt.show()

      plt.show()




Now that looks pretty darn good! How about we try integrating :math:`f(x)` now!
To do so, we simply take our values and multiply by the :math:`\Delta x` value
(the rectangle widths). It's important to note here that :math:`\Delta x` is not a
constant this time, so well need to compute an array of all of our
:math:`\Delta x` values first.


.. code-block:: default


    dx = np.pi/(128*4)
    x = np.arange(2/np.pi, 2*np.pi, step=dx)
    right = np.sum(f(x) * dx)
    right





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    2.1014656967879217



The right side there is pretty good
(`check with wolfram alpha <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+sin+1%2Fx+dx+from+x%3D2%2Fpi+to+2pi>`_)


.. code-block:: default



    def compute_left(dn, nn=1000):
        n = np.arange(1, nn, step=dn)
        xn = xx(n)
        dx = np.abs(np.diff(xn))
        return np.sum(f(xn)[:-1] * dx)

    left = compute_left(dn)
    left





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    0.17968499172741753



Well that's not very good as we know the true value for the left side to be
0.164619 `from Wolfram Alpha <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+sin+1%2Fx+dx+from+x%3D0+to+2%2Fpi+>`_.
Let's see if incresing the discretization helps.

    left = compute_left(0.0001)
    left

so that's not too bad of an approximation!

And there you have it! The integral of :math:`\sin(\frac{1}{x})` has been
numerically integrated!
