hi :wave: I'm Bane! I helped create [@PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista) and my passion is open source software for data visualization

I'm a geophysicist/hydrologist by training, but I've found my niche in open source software development. Check out the following pinned projects to see some of the work I am most eager to share!

This is my primary, public profile for open source. My work profile is separate: [@banesullivan-kobold](https://github.com/banesullivan-kobold)
