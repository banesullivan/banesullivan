hi :wave: I'm Bane! I created [@PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista) and my passion is open source software for data visualization

I'm a geophysicist/hydrologist by training, but I've found my niche in spatial visualization (geospatial and 3D). Check out the following pinned projects to see some of the work I am most eager to share!
