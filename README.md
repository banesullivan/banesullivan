hi :wave: I'm Bane! I co-created [@PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista) and I build tools that make 3D and geospatial visualization in Python intuitive and powerful.

***[Sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/banesullivan) supports ongoing maintenance, new features, and/or direct help with your visualization challenges.***

I'm a geophysicist/hydrologist by training, but I've found my niche in spatial visualization (geospatial and 3D). Check out the following pinned projects to see some of the work I am most eager to share!
