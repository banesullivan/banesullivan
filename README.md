hi :wave: I'm Bane! I helped start [@PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista) and my passion is creating open source software for data visualization

I am currently a Senior R&D Engineer [@Kitware](https://github.com/Kitware) working at the intersection of geoscience, visualization, and data science. I'm a geophysicist/hydrologist by training, but I've found my niche in open source software development. Check out the following pinned projects to see some of the work I am most eager to share!

## Open Source Office Hours

I host ***Open Source Office Hours*** on Thursdays each week. These are an opportunity for anyone to book time with me to talk Python, geoscience, and/or share/seek help with what you’re working on. [Schedule to come say hi!](https://calendly.com/bane-sullivan-kitware/open-source-office-hours)
