hi :wave: I'm Bane! I helped start [@PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista) and my passion is creating open source software for data visualization

I am currently a Research Software Engineer [@Kitware](https://github.com/Kitware) working at the intersection of geoscience, visualization, and data science. I'm a geophysicist/hydrologist by training, but I've found my niche in open source software development. Check out the following pinned projects to see some of the work I am most eager to share!
